    "_comment": "In this example, the optimization algorithm is set to use a learning rate of 0.01 and a momentum of 0.9. The RNN model is set to have an input size of 18 (corresponding to the length of the one-hotted input sequence), a hidden size of 128, an output size of 17 (corresponding to the length of the one-hotted output sequence), one layer, and a dropout rate of 0.2. You can adjust these hyperparameters as needed to improve the performance of the RNN model.",
